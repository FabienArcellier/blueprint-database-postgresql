## blueprint-cli-multicommands-python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FabienArcellier/blueprint-cli-multicommands-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FabienArcellier/blueprint-cli-multicommands-python)

blueprint which contains the prerequisite to manage a database according
to the pattern of evolutionary database design.

* build the database if it doesn't exists
* apply migration on the database if required

This blueprint could be used to :

* create a web application that depends on a database
* build a database for analytics with metabase as frontend
* ...

The implementation requires :

* ``postgresql``
* ``python3.8``

## Getting started

1. clone this repository

2. remove .git directory

3. use your library identifier as module name

    * replace `mycommand`, `mycommand_tests` by your own identifier
    * you have to change as well inside `Makefile`, `.coveragerc`, `tox.ini` and `setup.py`

## The latest version

You can find the latest version to ...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabienArcellier/blueprint-database-postgresql.git
```

## Usage

You can run the application with the following command

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Developper guideline

### Add a dependency

Write the dependency in ``setup.py``. As it's the distribution standard for pypi,
I prefer to keep ``setup.py`` as single source of truth.

I encourage avoiding using instruction as ``pipenv install requests`` to register
a new library. You would have to write your dependency in both ``setup.py`` and ``Pipfile``.

### Install development environment

Use make to instanciate a python virtual environment in ./venv and install the
python dependencies.

```bash
make install_requirements_dev
```

### Update release dependencies

Use make to instanciate a python virtual environment in ./venv and freeze
dependencies version on requirement.txt.

```bash
make update_requirements
```

### Activate the python environment

When you setup the requirements, a `venv` directory on python 3 is created.
To activate the venv, you have to execute :

```bash
make venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Run the linter and the unit tests

Before commit or send a pull request, you have to execute `pylint` to check the syntax
of your code and run the unit tests to validate the behavior.

```bash
make lint
make tests
```
